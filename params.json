{"name":"HTTP Session Replication","tagline":"Sample Web Session Replication App through Hazelcast","body":"<h1>ABOUT</h1>\r\nThis project is prepared to serve as a sample application for Hazelcast, the leading open source in-memory data grid . Here, Hazelcast's use case is HTTP Session Replication. \r\n \r\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\r\nYou should have installed Apache Tomcat7 and Apache Maven 3.2.1 on your system. Download links are given below. Choose appropriate one for you.\r\n\r\n`Apache Tomcat7` - http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi <br />\r\n`Apache Maven 3.2.1` - http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi<br />\r\n`Hazelcast 3.3-EA2` - http://hazelcast.com/products/hazelcast-enterprise/ \r\n\r\nExtract .zip file. Drop hazelcast-3.3-EA2-ee.jar and hazelcast-sessions-tomcat7-3.3-EA2.jar to your tomcat-installation-path/lib. They are under /lib of extracted folder.<br />\r\n\r\nNext, you must put hazelcast.xml file to tomcat-installation-directory/lib . You can find a sample hazelcast.xml file under extracted-hazelcast-folder/bin. Additionally, in hazelcast.xml, put your license key between \"license-key\" and \"/license-key\" tags. \r\n\r\nFinally, open tomcat7-installation-folder/conf/context.xml file and add this line\r\n\r\n`<Manager className=\"com.hazelcast.session.HazelcastSessionManager\" sticky=\"true\"/>`\r\n\r\nin \"Context\" and \"/Context\" tags.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Run Sample Application</h2>\r\n\r\nBEFORE-STARTING : Make sure tomcat-installation-path/startup.sh and tomcat-installation-path/shutdown.sh are executable. You can make them executable via `chmod +x startup.sh` and `chmod +x shutdown.sh` if your working directory is tomcat-installation-path. \r\n\r\n1) go to tomcat-installation-path/bin and run startup.sh shell file from terminal.\r\n\r\n2) clone the repository via `git clone https://github.com/hazelcastInternsSummer14/sessionReplicationApp.git`\r\n\r\n3) then go to sessionReplicationApp/firsthot folder.\r\n\r\n4) run maven via sudo `mvn tomcat:deploy`\r\n\r\n5) maven creates firstshot.war file under sessionReplicationApp/firsthot/target folder.\r\n\r\n6) copy firstshot.war file to tomcat7-installation-path/webapps folder\r\n\r\n7) open a browser and enter `localhost:8080/firstshot`\r\n\r\n8) username: `hazelcast` and password: `admin`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
